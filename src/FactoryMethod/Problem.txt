Problem: Payment Gateway Integration

Imagine you are building an e-commerce platform that supports multiple payment gateways (PayPal, Credit Card, etc.).
Each payment gateway has its own implementation for processing payments.
The platform needs to support new payment gateways in the future without modifying the existing codebase.


Requirements:
The system should be able to switch between different payment gateways dynamically.

Adding a new payment gateway should not require changes to the existing payment processing logic.

The client code should not be tightly coupled to specific payment gateway implementations.
