Now as you are a shadow man, the Egyptian General Intelligence "والعياذ بالله" gave you a mission to edit a public
API (lets call it "DataRepository" that allow users to query their saved data) for them
They told you that API must prevent system overload (too many requests per second).

Solution:
A Proxy Service will wrap the actual API and monitor the number of requests each user makes and limit them
with 1 request each 3 minutes.
