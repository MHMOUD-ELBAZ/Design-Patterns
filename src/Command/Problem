Let's create simulation for airpods controller app, we can assign a specific functionality to specific number of touches.
for example
single touch -> pause the music
double touch -> volume up
triple touch -> volume down

Requirements:
provide an API for controlling the airpods, assume there is an invisible power that will provide you with info like how many touches
needed for a specific action, and will invoke the appropriate methods when touches are counted.
