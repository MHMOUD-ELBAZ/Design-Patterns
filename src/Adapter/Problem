Assume that we building some application, in some part of this app we will display the weather status
and because i don't have sensors over the world, i found an external library that provide such service
i only pass the location to it and receive the weather status object but there is one problem:
looks like this is an american library which uses those weird units (fahrenheit, mile per second) and overall our
program, we use the standard units (celsius, meter per second)

Requirements:
Develop a way to enable us use this library from several classes in our program and avoid the repeated code to convert the result
